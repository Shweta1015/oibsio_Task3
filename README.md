This is basically an ATM machine software code which perform same functionalities like the real life ATM Machine.
In which this functions are performed: 1.Transaction History 
                                       2.Withdraw
                                       3.Deposit
                                       4.Transfer
                                       5.Quit 
                        
For creating this project we have created 4 seperated classes but within the same package to reduce complexity and easy understanding .
In the Atm class we have created private variable/method for all the named functions with its getter/setter and default constructor.
In the main class we have created user interface which ask and check for ATM Pin after validation also asks for all the 4 options above
and give output.
Third we creted an interface for accesing all variable method.
In operation class we have set all the logics and opeartions for selected options by implementing interface.
